1.2 Scope

  Loris+ is a software being developed that will allow the Wilfrid Laurier University student users an easier way to register for their courses while also improving the efficiency/updating courses for the admin users. 
This software will run in conjunction with the current Loris, thus Loris+ will also be a web based program. Loris+ will be running in conjunction with Loris because it will not run on every browser, only the newer ones. Every browser that runs MyLearningSpace will be compatible with Loris+. Loris will be kept only to cover any browser not compatible with Loris+. The Loris+ will be a web based program that will keep the students on a single page and be an easy graphic tool to put a class schedule together. Loris+ should be created so that a student can easily understand how to use it without training or need to continually referencing a manual. Loris+ will allow all Wilfrid Laurier University students to view/print their schedules, enroll/drop courses, and generally help organize their schedules more efficiently .

	Moving away from the student user, there also needs to be updates in efficiency for the database and an admin user.  The admin user will be someone who is setting up a course that will be at WLU.  They need to have an easy and efficient way of setting up or updating their courses.  This may allow better course explanation leading to a realization to students  about taking that course.   The database is the background system that holds all the information on the courses.  Updating this to new standards will be useful to anyone who needs it.  It should be like our other system that will be easy to use and efficiently put together.  This should not just make programming easier for us but future programmers who may need to use it.

	The benefits with Loris+ is that a lot of redundant steps are eliminated. For example when registering for a course on Loris you do not have your class schedule in front of you. Thus if a class is chosen it will take you back to the main page away from the class search. Though it may say that course is only for student who have declared that field of study their major or that there is a time conflict. This may cause confusion or annoy the user. Loris+ will inform the student user right away if they are eligible to be enrolled in that class. This saves time by allowing users to adjust their selection on the page where adjustments can actually be made. Another benefit is that you will have an actual printable version of your schedule on screen at all times. This will benefit during peak registration times, with fewer steps and mistakes a student can register in all their class more accurately and efficiently. The end goal of this software is to design it in a way that will be easy for students to register for courses.
