<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><h4><a id="Purpose">1.1 Purpose</a></h4></li>
		<p>Loris Plus provides its users with a new, sleek, and intuitive web based application for creating semesterly schedules at Wilfrid Laurier University. Loris Plus features technologies such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and PHP in order to provide a fast and secure user experience.</p>
	<li><h4><a id="Scope">1.2 Scope</a></h4></li>
	<li><h4><a id="Defs">1.3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations</a></h4></li>
	<li><h4><a id="Refrences">1.4 Refrences</a></h4></li>
	<li><h4><a id="Overview">1.5 Overview</a></h4></li>
		<p>The following section provides an overall description of LorisPlus as well as broadly detailed specifics concerning the product’s characteristics and constraints. It is to describe to the reader a generalisation pertaining to the required attributes of the product.</p>
		<p>These details are explained entirely within Section 3 of this document. However, that section mostly concerns the developers since it is the technical information behind the attributes and functionality of the product.</p>
		<p>Although both sections describe the same product, these sections are directed towards different audiences.</p>

		<h5>Criticality of the Application</h5>
		<p>In the case that our project will be approved by Loris, in the actual use of a school scheduling system, it would be highly important that it would be robust and fully functional. This means, no errors in the implementation of the program. Being able to cover all cases is a must. We do not want to compromise a users security. Since the users would be students, we do not want any private information leaking out. We should be aware of where we are storing the users information(eg. Cookies), and that it does not transfer over to another user logging in on the same machine for example. We want to make sure that user data is stored correctly, and retrieved correctly from the database. Most importantly, the scheduler must be easy to use and navigate through, so that it is intuitive for the unintuitive.</p>
		<h5>Time</h5>
		<p>The time constraint that has been put on our project is very necessary since this is a class project and this must be complete by the end of the term. What this means for the development of LorisPlus is that many components of the development will have to be streamlined or even done simultaneously with other parts of the project. This leaves room for error during different phases of the project. To ensure that we meet the deadline, we need to have a very organized and thorough design of LorisPlus, as well as keep expectations realistic for our time frame.</p>
		<h5>New Environment</h5>
		<p>We have been given the choice to choose the language(s) with which we will create LorisPlus, which means that we may choose a language that not everyone is familiar with. This means that during the development of our project, the staff will also be learning the language with which they are working, and therefore this might slow down the development and leave room for more mistakes to be made. To avoid such mistakes during development we need to be able to provide members of the staff with the necessary tools and resources so that they can be successful.</p>
		<h5>Availability of Staff</h5>
		<p>Every person that is part of our staff is also a student and thus has many other obligations both outside of the classroom and in. This creates difficulties when trying to organize and schedule different important meetings. The limited availability of our staff also means that it may take longer amounts of time to complete different components of LorisPlus. We must maximize the amount of work that we get done, based on the time we have. Thus, we must have a thorough design and a meticulous schedule to ensure that we will meet the deadline.</p>
		<h5>Interfacing to Other Applications</h5>
		<p> LorisPlus should interface with the actual Loris site and should not conflict. It should only deal with the scheduling section of Loris and the rest should not be altered or affected by our design. LorisPlus should be available when in the actual Loris site or possibly from the WLU website. Being able to go back and forth from LorisPlus and Loris is mandatory. LorisPlus software should run compatibly (i.e. under different browsers and with our database network) with the other subsystems software it works together with.</p>
